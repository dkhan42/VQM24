# VQM24
Some tools used for generating the VQM24 dataset

The PSI4 input file templates for DFT optimization+frequency calculation are present in the `template_DFT.in` file. The `scf_props.in` input file contains the template for subsequent single point SCF calculations for saving the wavefunction files and a few more one-electron properties which were not saved during optimization.

The python scripts are a few exemplary scripts out of many other which were used for submitting, retrieving, parsing, analyzing etc.
